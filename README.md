# 🧠 Low-Resource Machine Translation: Hindi ➡️ Tribal Language

Welcome to **Low-Resource-MT**, a lightweight yet effective machine translation project where Hindi is translated into a low-resource **tribal language**.  
Despite working with a small dataset of only **10,000 sentence pairs**, our model achieves a **BLEU score of 17**, demonstrating the potential of neural translation even in low-resource settings.

## 🧪 Inference & Translation

To test or translate using the model:

### 🔍 Inference (Single or Few Sentences)

Use the `infer.py` script:

```bash
python infer.py
```

### 📁 Translate the Test Dataset

Use the `trans.py` script for translating an entire test set:

```bash
python trans.py
```
